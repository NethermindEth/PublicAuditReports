Here, you can find the smart contract audit reports carried out by Nethermind Security, 
the security arm of Nethermind. The team uses manual inspection and automated analysis 
tools when performing security audits on Solidity and Cairo smart contracts.

## Audit Methodology

Our audit process is designed to identify vulnerabilities and ensure the robustness of smart contracts. This involves:

- **Manual Code Review**: Our security experts review the code to catch logic errors, code quality issues, and known vulnerabilities.
  
- **Automated Analysis**: We utilise our proprietary tools to analyse code for vulnerabilities.
  
- **Threat Modeling**: We evaluate potential attack vectors and assess the security of business logic and key functions.
  
- **Report Generation and Recommendations**: Each audit includes detailed findings, categorised by severity, and actionable recommendations to enhance security.

| S.no | Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Critical       | Immediate risk of fund loss or permanent damage.                                                                                                                      |
| 2.   | High           | Significant risk to security/functionality.                                                                                                                           |
| 3.   | Medium         | Limited risk or potential future vulnerability.                                                                                                                       |
| 4.   | Low            | Best practice recommendations.                                                                                                                                        |
| 5.   | Undetermined   | Findings where the impact requires additional context, third-party contract analysis, or specific deployment conditions to accurately assess the risk level           |
| 6.   | Informational  | Code quality and optimisation suggestions.                                                                                                                            |
| 7.   | Best Practices | Recommendations that don't pose immediate security risks but could improve code quality, gas efficiency, documentation clarity, or adherence to industry standards.   |
