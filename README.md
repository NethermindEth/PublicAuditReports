|------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.   | Critical       | Immediate risk of fund loss or permanent damage.                                                                                                                      |
| 2.   | High           | Significant risk to security/functionality.                                                                                                                           |
| 3.   | Medium         | Limited risk or potential future vulnerability.                                                                                                                       |

| 5.   | Undetermined   | Findings where the impact requires additional context, third-party contract analysis, or specific deployment conditions to accurately assess the risk level           |
| 6.   | Informational  | Code quality and optimisation suggestions.                                                                                                                            |
| 7.   | Best Practices | Recommendations that don't pose immediate security risks but could improve code quality, gas efficiency, documentation clarity, or adherence to industry standards.   |
